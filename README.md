# Password Generator

A password generator build within React.JS and Next.JS for the purpose of learning React.JS. This project doesn't fully 
capatalize on Next.JS's features, but rather uses it as a springboard to get a base to work from. The following technologies were utilized to a greater degree:

- **React.JS** -> Core to how the app functions.
- **JavaScript** -> Since functionality is basic, a statically typed language such as Typescript would be overkill
- **Sass (SCSS format)** -> CSS preprocessing and structuring.
- **Jest** -> Unit testing

## Project setup

First, run npm install to set up all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app

Secondly, run the development server using the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your choice of browser to access the app. During development the app 
was mostly tested in Google Chrome in both standard and reactive mode.
